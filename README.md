# Guake-pentest
A text file that contains most of the commands that we run during hackthebox enumeration and exams like OSCP that can be easy be viewed by guake
Guake is a terminal which you can hide and show by setting up certain key bindings.
In a pentest or HTB you may notice that running the same commands again and again is frustrating so guake can help you in this scenario this enum.sh should be run in guake so that
it can be easily used to view your enum commands that you run for HTB reducing most of the burden.

# How Set Up Guake for Pentest
1)Go kali search and search for guake preferences and then make sure everyhing is configured as your need
2)Go to keyboard shortcuts > toggle guake visibility > your key binding (mine is ctrl + g)
3)Now go to session and startup and add guake to ensure it run's in background every time your system reboot
4)restart your system and use your keybinding to bring up guake

# Usage
Use your key binding go to the directory where enum.sh is present
run ./enum.sh <victim_ip> <victim_hostname>
